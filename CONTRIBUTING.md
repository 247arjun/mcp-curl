## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in the `src/` directory

3. Build and test your changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and concise

### Testing

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test manually with actual MCP clients when possible
- Include edge cases and error conditions

## Adding New curl Features

When adding new curl functionality:

1. **Research the curl option**: Understand the curl command-line option thoroughly
2. **Design the tool interface**: Create a clear, intuitive tool schema
3. **Implement the handler**: Add the logic in `src/index.ts`
4. **Add error handling**: Handle edge cases and provide clear error messages
5. **Write tests**: Test both success and failure scenarios
6. **Update documentation**: Add examples to README.md

### Example Tool Implementation

```typescript
// Add to the tools array
{
  name: "curl_new_feature",
  description: "Description of what this does",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      url: { type: "string", description: "URL to request" },
      option: { type: "string", description: "New option description" }
    },
    required: ["url"]
  }
}

// Add handler case
case "curl_new_feature":
  return await handleNewFeature(request.params.arguments);
```

## Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update DEPLOYMENT.md for configuration changes
- Include examples for new features

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases, but contributors should:
- Update version numbers if needed
- Update CHANGELOG.md with their changes
- Tag any breaking changes clearly

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Ask questions in issue comments
- Reach out to maintainers for major changes
- Review MCP documentation for protocol questions

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- CHANGELOG.md for their contributions
- GitHub contributors list
- Release notes for significant contributions
